# Service worker + Tagesschau API

This project explores how to use a service worker to implement a cache-first strategy when fetching news from the Tagesschau API.

### Features
- Loads and displays news articles using the [Tagesschau public API](https://www.tagesschau.de/api2/).
- Implements a cache-first approach using a service worker.
- Supports offline access: the web can still show previously loaded news even if the network is poor or unavailable (e.g., server down or offline mode).

### ðŸš§ Notes

- This project is intended for learning and experimenting with service workers and caching strategies.
